"""
quixote.server.medusa is a subset of the Medusa code; only those parts
required to run an HTTP server are included.

Medusa is a 'server platform' -- it provides a framework for
implementing asynchronous socket-based servers (TCP/IP and on Unix,
Unix domain, sockets).

Medusa was originally written by Sam Rushing <rushing@nightmare.com>,
and its original Web page is at <http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/>. After
Sam moved on to other things, A.M. Kuchling <akuchlin@mems-exchange.org>
took over maintenance of the Medusa package.

Medusa is available at http://www.amk.ca/python/code/medusa .
