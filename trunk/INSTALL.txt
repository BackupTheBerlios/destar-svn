Installation
-=-=-=-=-=-=


Needed Software
===============

Python
------

Get and install Python. I use Python 2.3 for development, but maybe Python
2.2 would suffice.


Quixote
-------

Then install Quixote 1.x, *NOT* 0.6.1 nor 2.X.

If you can't find it in your Linux distribution, then download the source
from http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/quixote/


Optional: SQLite / pysqlite
---------------------------

This is only needed for the CDR (call detail record) part. Get SQLite from
your distribution, it should be version 2.x. If you don't find it, then
install it from http://www.sqlite.org

pysqlite is not in many distributions, but you can find it at
http://pysqlite.sourceforge.net/


Optional: Pychart
-----------------

This is needed for generate graphical reports about the number and time of
the calls made with your PBX. 

You can download it from http://home.gna.org/pychart/ , or get it from your
distribution.


Install Destar
--------------

Run

   # make clean  make install

in the directory where you have stored destar.


Execution
=========

Stand-alone
-----------

If you have all the prerequisites, then start the destar script 
using 'destar' as root. You should see something like:

   # destar
   warning: Computing default hostname
   info: Medusa (V1.1) started at Thu Jul 15 09:34:18 2004
        Hostname: mnz66.mn-solutions.de
        Port:8080

Now point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080.


Via Web-Server
--------------

With Quixote comes a file doc/web-server.txt that explains how to run
Quixote Web Applications under Web Servers like Apache. They explain on how
to use it with FastCGI, mod_scgi, mod_python.

You cannot run DESTAR as normal CGI, otherwise we'd have to load and store
the whole configuration at each invocation and that would be painfully slow.
