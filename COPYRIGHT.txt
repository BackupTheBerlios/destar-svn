As the GPL says, you can use this code commercially. You don't have to pay

And you have to GPL all the code that links to DeStar. So, if you create
your own cfg_*.py or other any other file that get's linked, this code has
to be GPLed as well and has to be given to your customers as well.

You can get an exemption from this if you obtain a commercial license from
me. Please contact me to settle an agreement.
